                TruTraderFx was created to help forex traders around the world, from beginner to expert level, reach their true potential. 
        
        We have proudly developed a simple and low-risk service for customers. Offering a range of funding options and services that cater to diverse talents, skills and needs.
        
        Our accounts are fully funded, meaning any losses are removed from personal liability. To accomplish this, each of our account options requires a monthly fee. This fee allows us to operate without a loss and ensures traders can continue trading with our financial support. 
        
        truTrader believes that the road to success starts with a strong foundation which is why we created truTrader University. Our educational videos and resources have been carefully curated to help traders grow their skills and strengthen any trader's foundation.
